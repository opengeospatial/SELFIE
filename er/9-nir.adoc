=== Non-information resources

The SELFIE content model, with its loosely-defined non-information, meta, and data tiers, is focused on the nature of a resource and not the structure of the identifier used to dereference the resource. However, there is a need to establish expected behavior when dereferencing URIs for information at each of these three tiers. As discussed in <<ELFIEResources>>, the SELFIE project found that the distinction between meta and data tiers is loose and should be the subject of future work. The IE considered two behaviors between non-information and information resources that provide landing content: 1) A 303 redirect from a URI-14 to a URL-14, and 2) Indirect identification of the non-information resource where the URI-14 and URL-14 are identical. +
The distinction between non-information resources and resources that provide landing-content located with different URIs introduces the potential for confusion. This confusion was anticipated to produce two issues:

. Search engine Indexes of landing content might incorrectly record associations with the URL-14 (a less-permanent information identifier) rather than the URI-14 (a more permanent non-information identifier) that the landing content references.
. URL-14s that are displayed in a browser URL bar after a 303-redirect could easily get copied and used as an indirect identifier when a URI-14 exists and should be used instead.
SELFIE participants tested the former by exposing a pilot infrastructure to the public internet and found that, as long as landing content references the URI-14, search engine indexes work appropriately. The second issue can be mitigated by placing prominent URI-14s on the html representation of landing content and structure URL-14s in such a way that it is clear that they are not meant to be used as identifiers. +

Indirect identification of URI-14s using URL-14s has been tested by SELFIE participants successfully. It was found that this practice limits flexibility of systems to accommodate multiple agencies and the tight coupling of URI-14 and URL-14 introduces technical challenges for landing content resolution. However, the practice is less complicated from a user perspective and, as long as the URL-14s are stable, is compatible with future decoupling of URI-14 and URL-14 when the separation is needed. These two cases, 303 and 200 response codes to a non-information resource identifier, illustrate the flexibility of the SELFIE content model as well as the nature of landing-content as a convenient resource that encodes content relating URI-14s to each other and data resources.

An important recommendation IE participants agreed to is that when a 303-redirect from a URI-14 to URL-14 exists, the *URL-14 should not be referenced in structured data*. This follows from the fact that the URL-14 is a locator for landing content with one and only one subject -- the URI-14. That is, a JSON-LD representation of a URL-14 resource would have one and only one root `@id` that is the URI-14 that the JSON-LD documents. As such, the URL-14 should never appear in a linked data graph as it will never return linked data about itself.
