== Example Clause

[NOTE]
.Instructions
===============================================
This section explains some concepts frequently required by Asciidoc novices. Please use this file as a template for your own clauses.
===============================================

=== Headlines
All headlines are marked by "=" signs. The top level in each each file starts with level 2 ("=="). Important: For whatever strange reason, headings in annexes are marked differently.

=== Figures
If you want to reference a figure by using a figure number, it is important to use the following syntax. The figure identifier for <<img_mindMap>> is the first statement of the header. Please adapt the width as appropriate, but generally a width of 800 is good for landscape-shaped figures and 400 is good for portrait-shaped ones.

[#img_mindMap,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.This is an example figure
image::images/placeholder.png[width=600,align="center"]

It is important that you use the same syntax for all images, otherwise the automatic numbering is corrupted!

=== Tables
Tables are easy to deal with as long as you keep them simple! To add a table, please use the following syntax.

[#table_countries,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Countries in Europe
[cols="50e,^25m,>25s",width="75%",options="header",align="center"]
|===
|Country | Population | Size

| Monaco
| 36371
| 1.98

| Gibraltar
| 29431
| 6.8
|===

The first line is used for referencing. You can reference <<table_countries>> in your text. The only thing you should change in that line is the table id, which is "table_countries" in this case. Please do not remove the "#", please do not change anything else in that line.

You can define the style and width of each column. In our example, the first column takes 50% of the entire width, the second and third column take 25% each. The total width of the table is 75% of the text width.

The letters after the width percentage indicate if the column is e=emphasis, m=monospaced, a=asciidoc, s=strong. The d=default does not need to be set.

Cell alignment: If you need to align a column, you may indicate this by setting ^,<, or >. Examples:

* ^25m = centered, 25% width, monospaced.
* >25e = aligned right, 25% width, emphasised
* <25 = aligned left, 25% width, asciidoc

In any case, please make sure that your table fit on a piece of A4 or letter-size paper!!

[[RecommendedAsciidocEnvironment]]
=== Recommended Asciidoc Environment

We recommend to use http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] in combination with the https://atom.io[Atom] editor.

==== Installation on MacOS and Linux
. Please follow the steps on https://asciidoctor.org/#installation.
. Install the bibtex extension: _gem install asciidoctor-bibtex_


==== Installation on Windows
We have made best experiences with the following steps:

. Install ruby for windows: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. If you experience any issues, the following link may help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18908708/installing-ruby-gem-in-windows[stackoverflow]

. Open command prompt and install two gems:
.. Execute: "gem install asciidoctor"
.. Execute: "gem install asciidoctor-bibtex"

. Text your installation
.. Open a folder that contains your Engineering Report asciidoc source files, including the _er.adoc_ file.
.. Execute the following command: _asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex er.adoc_

==== Using Asciidoctor with Atom
In Atom, you should install the following packages:

* asciidoc-preview
* autocomplete-asciidoc
* language-asciidoc
* markdown-writer: requires changing of key-map to allow for keyboard shortcuts such as e.g. *bold*
* platformio-IDE-terminal

This environment allows you to use keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and a rendered preview for asciidoc; and provides you an terminal window within the editor to convert your asciidoc to html and pdf.

=== Asciidoc Conversion
In order to achieve a uniform look-and-feel of all ERs in both HTML and PDF, we have provided a css and theme file. The following commands can be used to convert the ER:

*Command for PDF output:*
 asciidoctor-pdf -r asciidoctor-bibtex -a pdf-stylesdir=resources -a pdf-style=ogc -a pdf-fontsdir=resources/fonts er.adoc

*Command for HTML output:*
asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex -a linkcss -a stylesheet=rocket-panda.css -a stylesdir=./stylesheets er.adoc

=== Source Code

You can add code snippets using the following syntax:

.Code Example XML
[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title> <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> This notation allows to reference particular sections within the code.

You can alternatively use line numbers to reference a specific section in your code.


.Code Example JSON
[source,json,linenumbers]
----
{"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  }
}}
----

As shown in line 2, the value of "id" is "File".

=== Asciidoc(tor) Syntax Help
Is available e.g. here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/

=== Citations
Please use the following syntax to insert citations anywhere in the text:

----
cite:[VanZyl2009]
----

or, if it is more than one citation that should be added at the same location, use

----
cite:[Pross2018,OGCTechTrends2018]
----

which will create links in the compiled HTML/PDF that look as follows: cite:[VanZyl2009], of for the second example given above, it results in cite:[Pross2018,OGCTechTrends2018]


Then you need to provide all citation information in the file resources/bibtex-file.bib. This file uses the bibtex file format, which is defined in full detail http://www.bibtex.org/Format/[here]. The bibtex-style file shall remain untouched.

The conversion of _cite:[]_ takes place at the time of asciidoc-to-pdf/html conversion and requires two things:

. The definition of the _bibtex-file_ and the _bibtex-style_ attributes. This is done in this template in file <<bibtexAttributes,er.adoc>>. Please make sure that both files are available at their defined locations.

----
Examples of bibtex attributes as set in file er.adoc

:bibtex-file: resources/bibtex-file.bib
:bibtex-style: resources/lncs.csl
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Adding a flag to the asciidoctor conversion command

----
asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex er.adoc
----

A full conversion command could look as in the following example:

====
asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex -a linkcss -a s
tylesheet=rocket-panda.css -a stylesdir=./resources/stylesheets er.adoc
====
